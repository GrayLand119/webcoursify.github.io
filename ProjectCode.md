You can access the code via [github](https://github.com/WebCoursify/src-code-for-full-stack-web-platform) now! 

The code in **final** branch is the finished version! Feel free to dig into it and figure out how does the reference code solve the requirements. I won't say my solution is the best, so I welcome anyone to make a better proposal. 

You'll need to start from this demo project and follow the instructions on course content. By doing so you'll eventually finish this platform. Good luck!
