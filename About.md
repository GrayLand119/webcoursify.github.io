This is a mini-course that teach about web development. This is for who have programming experiences (at least wrote some programs -- no matter what languages), and want to quickly learn the ability to develop web systems (including but not limited to websites we see everyday). 

### What you'll get

Here're what you'll get when you finish this course:

1.  A full-stack understanding of Web Development components, from Front-End to Back-End to Database.
2.  Your understanding of components won't be restricted in the framework used by this course(Django) only. They're very general principles and can generalize to other web frameworks, even non-website systems.
3.  Hand-on experiences of developing a complete project independently.
4.  Of course, the project itself. You can show off to your friends, or further improve it to publish it online! 
5.  If you're looking for a job related to web development (internship or full-time job), I hope this will be something that can make your resume better.

### Requirements

We would need you to have some coding experiences. Besides, knowledge of the following topics will be of much help:

1.  Basic syntax of Python, Javascript. The project uses Python as the language for the server side. Javascript is used for front-end development

2.  What HTML/CSS look like, and have the basic ability to understand them (for example, one should know "<a\>" represents a hyperlink). Use the following questiosn to test your knowledge on these:

    1.  The meaning and usage of the following html tags:

            <form action="/submit" method="GET"> </form>
            <input type="text/" value="..." placeholder="..." />  
            <a href="/home" >...</a>   
            <img src="..."  />  
            <head> ... </head>
            <script src="init.js" > ... </script>
            ...

    2.  For CSS understand these definitions and properties:  

            div{ margin: auto;}  
            .auto-margin{ margin: auto}  
            .float-left{ float: left}
            #container {width: 1070px;}
            .img-container > img{margin: 10px;}
            .item-container .item {padding: 10px; width: 33%;}
            .gallery.container {width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;}

3.  Basic understanding of database(here I mean relational database like MySQL)

### How the course work:  

*   At the very beginning, you will be provided a simple sample code, which is a Django demo project. During the learning of each chapter there will be assignments, for which students will be required to implement some new and small functionalities inside the demo project

*   At the end, there'll be a relatively "big" assignment, which may count as a small individual project. Students will be required to implement a sub-system based on the code they have

*   Some chapters will have quiz questions after sections or at the end. We're trying to work on that
