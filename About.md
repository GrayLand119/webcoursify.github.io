This is a mini-course that teach about web development. This is for who have programming experiences (at least wrote some programs -- no matter what languages), and want to quickly learn the ability to develop web systems (including but not limited to websites we see everyday). 

### What you'll get

Here're what you'll get when you finish this course:

*   A full-stack understanding of Web Development components, from Front-End to Back-End to Database.
*   Your understanding of components won't be restricted in the framework used by this course(Django) only. They're very general principles and can generalize to other web frameworks, even non-website systems.
*   Hand-on experiences of developing a complete project independently.
*   Of course, the project itself. You can show off to your friends, or further improve it to publish it online! 
*   If you're looking for a job related to web development (internship or full-time job), I hope this will be something that can make your resume better.

### Requirements

We would need you to have some coding experiences. Besides, knowledge of the following topics will be of much help:

*   Basic syntax of Python, Javascript. The project uses Python as the language for the server side. Javascript is used for front-end development
*   Knowledge of HTML/CSS. You'll need this to develop front-end web page.
*   Basic understanding of database(here I mean relational database like MySQL)

### How the course work:  

*   At the very beginning, you will be provided a Django demo project. During the learning of each chapter there will be assignments, and you're expected to add new functionalities to the demo project
*   At the end, there'll be a capstone project. Finishing the project makes a completed well-functioned platform.
*   Some chapters will have quiz questions (We're trying to work on that)

Now, you can start! The sidebar on the right list out the course content. You may also visit the [demo page](http://webdemo.zhangty.me/). Here's a finished version of the capstone project.

This course is under active development. If you'll willing to contribute you can visit the [github repo](https://github.com/WebCoursify/webcoursify.github.io). If you have any feedback, you're very welcome to [email us](mailto:{{site.email}})
