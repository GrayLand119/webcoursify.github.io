This is a mini-course that teach about web development. This is for who have programming experiences (at least wrote some programs -- no matter what languages), and want to quickly learn the ability to develop web systems (including but not limited to websites we see everyday). 

### What you'll get

Here're what you'll get when you finish this course:

1.  A full-stack understanding of Web Development components, from Front-End to Back-End to Database.
2.  Your understanding of components won't be restricted in the framework used by this course(Django) only. They're very general principles and can generalize to other web frameworks, even non-website systems.
3.  Hand-on experiences of developing a complete project independently.
4.  Of course, the project itself. You can show off to your friends, or further improve it to publish it online! 
5.  If you're looking for a job related to web development (internship or full-time job), I hope this will be something that can make your resume better.

### Prerequisites

Basically, before starting this course, students should:  

1.  Know the basic syntax of Python, Javascript  
2.  Know what HTML/CSS look like, and have the basic ability to understand them (for example, one should know "<a\>" represents a hyperlink). If not, come back when you at least understand the followings:
    1.  The meaning and usage of the following html tags:

            <form action="/submit" method="GET"> </form>
            <input type="text/" value="..." placeholder="..." />  
            <a href="/home" >...</a>   
            <img src="..."  />  
            <head> ... </head>
            <script src="init.js" > ... </script>
            ...

    2.  For CSS understand these definitions and properties:  

            div{ margin: auto;}  
            .auto-margin{ margin: auto}  
            .float-left{ float: left}
            #container {width: 1070px;}
            .img-container > img{margin: 10px;}
            .item-container .item {padding: 10px; width: 33%;}
            .gallery.container {width: 90%; margin-left: 5%;}

3.  Have basic understanding of database(here I mean relational database like MySQL)

### How the course work:  

*   At the very beginning, students will be provided a simple sample code, which is a Django demo project. During the learning of each chapter there will be assignments, for which students will be required to implement some new and small functionalities inside the demo project.  
*   At the end, there'll be a relatively "big" assignment, which may count as a small individual project. Students will be required to implement a sub-system based on the code they have.  
*   Some chapters will have quiz questions after sections or at the end.   

Finally, to prove that we're serious, you'll get a score for your performance in this course. Of course, we trust you to be honest so we'll ask you to evaluate yourself. 

*   We'll provide test programs for each programming assignment and project. These programs will print out the scores you get.  
*   Each quiz question has score too. Be honest. 

When you're done, we hope you can report your score to us.
