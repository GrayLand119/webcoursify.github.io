In this chapter, we will show what a typical web system project looks like, using our demo project(which is written with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) as an example. Although using Django for illustration, some concepts here are widely adopted by many different web frameworks instead of only being used in Django. 

Specifically, we'll first introduce the basic Client-Server Model and the MVC pattern, then we'll look at the architecture of a typical django project.
